# Interview Code Review
This repository contains a number of coding examples, with various degrees of code problems. The point of this repository is to provide code for a "mock" code review that will let individuals evaluate and identify common coding mistakes.

## Goals
1. Review the code and identify mistakes or things that could have been done better.
1. Focus on common coding mistakes, for the targeted platform, rathern than the logic/behavior.

## What to Evaluate
The point of this excercise is not to necessarily comprehend the code base, but rather to spot bad or inconsistent coding behaviours. The code examples are meant to provide small stand-alone samples that don't require any context.

__Focus on:__
* Styling
* Consistency
* Usage of tools available in the language/platform (ES5 vs ES6)
* Standards and best practices
